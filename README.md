My final project for Harvard's CS50 is a Chrome extension called NeverAgain. This tool addresses the common issue of forgetting usernames or passwords immediately after creating an account. NeverAgain allows users to quickly save and access their credentials directly from the browser toolbar, simplifying the process of managing account information.

Inspired by CS50 problem sets, I initially planned to build a website but soon realized that a browser extension would offer a more practical solution. The development journey involved learning .json coding with support from freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, along with occasional assistance from ChatGPT. Despite challenges, including troubleshooting persistent errors, the internet provided invaluable resources for implementing HTML and CSS.

The project consists of three main components: the Manifest File (manifest.json), the Popup HTML (popup.html), and the JavaScript Script (notif.js). The .json file defines the extension's identity, permissions, and responses to user actions. The popup.html file creates a user-friendly interface for managing credentials, and popup.js handles user interactions, ensuring seamless data exchange with Chrome's storage.

NeverAgain is a solution born from personal frustration, designed to make everyday tasks easier and more secure.
